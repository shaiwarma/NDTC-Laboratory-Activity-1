    <h3 style="color: white">
      Fried Garlic Chicken is a crispy fried chicken in a thick and savoury
      garlic sauce; this dish is most certainly for the garlic lover. Prepared
      with a unique battering technique, and double fried, this chicken is sweet
      and super garlicky – it’s made with twelve cloves of garlic!

    <h2 style="color: whitesmoke">Bringing the Dish Together:</h2>
    <ul>
      <li style="color: white">3/4 cup cornstarch</li>
      <li style="color: white">1 small onion, sliced into 1/4 inch slices</li>
      <li style="color: white">12 cloves garlic, minced</li>
      <li style="color: white">1 teaspoon fresh ginger, grated</li>
      <li style="color: white">
        1/2 cup green onions, cut into 1 inch lengths
      </li>
      <li style="color: white">1 tablespoon toasted sesame seeds</li>
      <li style="color: white">
        oil for frying, vegetable, canola, or peanut oil
      </li>
    </ul>

    <h2 style="color: whitesmoke">Instructions</h2>
    <ul>
      <li style="color: white">
        Add the cornstarch to a wide, shallow bowl – like a pasta bowl. Gently
        shimmy the bowl to settle the cornstarch. Next, pour in the water, but
        avoid pouring the water directly onto the cornstarch. Pour the water
        down the side of the bowl in a light stream until you have about an inch
        of water floating on top of the cornstarch. Set this aside and do not
        move it until ready to use.
      </li>
      <li style="color: white">
        Add the chicken pieces to another bowl with the soy sauce, salt, and
        ground black pepper. Toss well to coat and set aside. Let the chicken
        marinate for about 10 minutes.
      </li>
      <li style="color: white">
        Add the sauce ingredients to a bowl and whisk well to combine. Set that
        aside.
      </li>
      <li style="color: white">
        Next, mince the garlic, grate the ginger, chop the green onions, and
        slice the onion. Set these things aside until ready to use.
      </li>
      <li style="color: white">
        Finally, add four inches of vegetable oil to a heavy bottomed pot. Turn
        on the heat and heat the oil to 315 degrees F.
      </li>
      <li style="color: white">
        Transfer the bowl of cornstarch to the sink and very gently and
        carefully pour the liquid out of the bowl. The cornstarch should have
        settled into the bottom of the bowl and has not transformed from a light
        powder to a solid. Use a fork to break up the cornstarch. It will be
        thick, but very manageable. Transfer the marinated chicken to the
        cornstarch and toss well to combine. The mixture will be gooey and thick
        – this is normal!
      </li>
      <li style="color: white">
        Once the oil is hot, use tongs to lower the chicken into into the oil
        one piece at a time. Don’t overcrowd the pot. I tend to fry them off
        about a dozen pieces at a time. The chicken fries really quickly; it
        only needs about 5-6 minutes.
      </li>
      <li style="color: white">
        Once all of the chicken is fried, increase the heat of the oil to 350
        degrees. Carefully place all of the chicken back into the oil. This is
        what I refer to as the second fry and it will add further crisp to your
        chicken and it only needs another 3-4 minutes. Remove from the oil and
        drain well.
      </li>
      <li style="color: white">
        Add one tablespoon of the vegetable oil used for frying the chicken to a
        large skillet. Over medium-high heat, add the onions and fry until just
        cooked through – about three to five minutes.
      </li>
      <li style="color: white">
        Next, add in all of the garlic and ginger. Stir well and cook for one
        minute.
      </li>
      <li style="color: white">
        Pour in the prepared sauce and stir well. Increase the heat to high and
        add in all of the chicken. Toss the chicken well into the sauce and
        garlic mixture.
      </li>
      <li style="color: white">
        Add in the green onions and the sesame seeds. Continue to move the
        chicken about the skillet until the sauce has thickened and the water
        content has evaporated. Once done, transfer to a plate and garnish.
      </li>
    </ul>
